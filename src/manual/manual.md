## Playground Help

Using Playground involves 3 steps:

- Connecting to the hardware control interface
- Discovering and activating hardware
- Controlling hardware

### Controlling Hardware

Once hardware has been activated, you will see control sliders in the
main panel of the application.

For vibrating and rotating components, moving the sliders will cause
hardware to move.

For linear (stroking/thrusting) components, the min/max oscillation
positions can be set, as well as the travel time between these two
positions. Movement will begin with the _Start Oscillation_ button is
clicked.
